P&A Group Project (D2W Logistics)
---------------------------------

- Overview: B2B-focused application for managing offers and inquiries related to overseas container freight
	capacity for last-minute shipping needs
	- Users would be shipping businesses that are looking for and/or have additional container freight capacity
		to be used for fulfilling overbooked shipments or unscheduled, last-minute shipping requests

*** MVP REQUIREMENTS ***
------------------------

- Application home page should welcome user and prompt for a login
	- Link or button for redirection to an account registration page will also be included for new users

- Home page/login page will have email and password prompts

- Registration page will have prompts for:
	- Name of shipping company
	- User's first name
	- User's last name
	- Email address
	- Mobile phone number (reserved for future use for SMS alerts, etc.)
	- Shipper's primary market/type of goods (drop-down with hard-coded examples - would be database-driven later)
	- Password
	- Confirm password
	
- All fields on registration page are required; email format check; password match check

- Once registered, user is automatically logged in (not redirected back to login)

- After login or registration/login, user is presented with list of all available container capacity that matches
	their primary market
	- There will be an button/checbox/etc. to allow the user to toggle between showing available capacity for just
		their primary market (default view upon login) and showing all available capacity
	- The capacity that the user has offered will either be shown at the top of the listing or will be shown in
		a separate section for easier management

- Available capacity listing will show:
	- Scheduled date of departure
	- Departure port
	- Destination port(s)
	- Number of 40-foot containers
	- Refrigerated indicator
	- Hazardous/government-regulated indicator
	- Button for redirection to page for completing an inquiry/reservation about the capacity

- For capacity that is being offered by the current user, buttons for editing and deleting the capacity will be shown
	- Might add a way to also mark a capacity as reserved so that it can be highlighted on the shipper's capacity
		listing to differentiate that capacity from ones that are still available

- Listing page will have a button for offering new capacity

- Page for adding or editing a capacity will have fields for:
	- Scheduled date of departure (date picker - see wireframe)
	- Departure port
	- Destination port(s) (should allow selecting multiple ports from scrollable list)
	- Number of 40-foot containers (scrollable number selector - see wireframe)
	- Refrigerated indicator
	- Type of goods allowed or "unrestricted" (would be used for matching to shipper's primary market)
	- Email address of contact (new capacity screen will pre-populate this with email address in user's profile)

- Inquiry/reservation page will have the following fields:
	- Uneditable/display-only capacity information:
		- Scheduled date of departure
		- Departure port
		- Number of 40-foot containers
		- Refrigerated indicator
		- Hazardous/government-regulated indicator
		- Type of goods allowed
	- Date needed (date picker - see wireframe; include validation that this date has to be before the scheduled departure date)
	- Destination port (drop-down showing the destination ports defined for the capacity)
	- Email address for contact (pre-populated with email address in user's profile)

- Submitted inquiry/reservation request will send an email to the shipper who listed the capacity with the details
	of the request
	- Future feature would also send them an SMS to alert of a new request


*** FEATURE BACKLOG ***
-----------------------

- SMS alerts for new reservation requests and availability of new capacity

- Ability to specify the portion of the capacity needed when making a reservation
	- This would be coupled with the shipper's ability to mark only a portion of a capacity as reserved
		thereby allowing the remainder of the capacity to be available for other reservations
